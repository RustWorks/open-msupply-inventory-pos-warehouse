# Open mSupply

This is the home of an open source version of the popular [mSupply](https://msupply.org.nz/) - providing pharmaceutical supply chain management and dispensing, all the way from national warehouses to remote clinics, on servers, laptops and mobile.
Used in over 30 countries and for over 20 years and now becoming open source software.

The code is separated into two main areas, the client and server:

### Client
Built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a responsive, multi-lingual, web based client, also packaged as both a desktop and android app.

For more information, [read the client developer docs](client/README.md)


### Server
Built to be fast and reliable using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and supporting either [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) databases.

For more information, [read the server developer docs](server/README.md)
