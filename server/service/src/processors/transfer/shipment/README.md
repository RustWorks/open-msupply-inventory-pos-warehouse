## Request Requisition linked to Inbound Shipment

When an inbound shipment is created from outbound shipment, we check for a requisition linked to the outbound shipment (response requisition) and check which request requisition is linked to that response requisition and link the inbound shipment with correct request requisition

## Invoice Line on Update

When an outbound shipment is updated and an inbound shipment is already generated, invoice lines will be dropped and reinstated to match the outbound shipment (this is the simplest way to update potentially changed invoice lines)
