# Plugin Validation

Plugins can modify the behaviour of mSupply and can potentially leak confidential information.
For this reason its important that plugins come from a trusted party.
For example, a malicious user could tricky an mSupply user to install a modified plugin.
To avoid this, plugins are signed and only plugins that can be verified to come from a trusted party are loaded.

To sign a plugin, a trusted party needs a private key for signing a plugin and a matching public certificate which is later used for verifying that the plugin hasn't been modified.
The public certificate can either be self-signed or signed by another trusted party.
Using this key pair, a plugin can be signed using the mSupply cli.
A signed plugin contains a `manifest.json` and `manifest.signature` file.
Besides others, the `manifest.json` file contains a list of plugin files and their hashes.
Moreover, it contains the public certificate.

To validate a plugin, the mSupply remote server needs to validate that it trusts the certificate that comes with the plugin (which is stored in the `manifest.json`).
This is done by verifying the certificate against a list of trusted certificates which are stored in the `app_data/plugin_certs` directory.
If the plugin certificate is trusted, it is then validated that the `manifest.json` file matches the `manifest.signature`.
The `manifest.json` file is then used to only server plugin files that are listed in the manifest.

# Generating Keys

There are two types of public validation certificates.

1. Self-singed certificates: These self-signed certificates need to be copied to the `app_data/plugin_certs`
2. Certificates that are signed by a trusted party: These certificated must be signed by a certificate already in the `app_data/plugin_certs` server directory

## Self-signed Certificates

A self-signed certificate can, for example, be generated using:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.pem -out public.pem -nodes
```

In this example, the `public.pem` file needs to be copied to the `app_data/plugin_certs` server directory.

## Certificates that are signed by a trusted party

A 3rd party plugin developer can generate their own keypair and then let sign their certificate by mSupply:

1. A private singing key and public certificate signing request (CSR) needs to be generated:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private_3rd.pem -out public_3rd.csr -nodes
```

The signing request (e.g. `public_3rd.csr`) needs to be sent to mSupply.

2. mSupply signs the request using their own key-pair like:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in public_3rd.csr -CA public.pem -CAkey private.pem -out public_3rd.pem -sha256
```

The `public_3rd.pem` file is sent back to the 3rd plugin developer.

3. The 3rd developer can now sign their plugin using `private_3rd.pem`and`public_3rd.pem`.

# Plugin Signing

The CLI interface can then be used sign a plugin.
This will place the `manifest.json` and the `manifest.signature` file into the plugin directory.
For example:

```bash
cargo run --profile fast --bin remote_server_cli -- sign-plugin -p ./app_data/plugins/StockDonor/ -k pathtokeys/private.pem -c pathtokeyskey/public.pem
```

# Development

In development mode the plugin validation is disabled.
However, validation errors are still shown in the remote server logs.
