## Welcome
Thanks for visiting our developer documentation.

If you're looking for "How to use mSupply" documentation, you're in the wrong place. For "old" mSupply they're [here](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/) and for Open mSupply they're not ready yet. Stay tuned.

## Contributing
We realise you might read these docs for a number of reasons:
* You might just be interested.
* You might have forked mSupply and want to know how to modify it. 
* You might be considering extending mSupply by writing a plugin.
* Or you might be considering contributing, to the main code base.

Any of those reasons are welcome, and we hope these docs help you. Please make an issue for errors you find, and ideally make a branch & a PR to fix the error. Thanks!

## Getting Started

Have a read of the [Key Concepts page â†’](key-concepts/) to get an understanding of the mSupply ecosystem.
