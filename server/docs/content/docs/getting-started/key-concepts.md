## Synchronisation

* Synchronisation is a key feature of the mSupply system and core to how mSupply works.
* Open mSupply only supports the v5 sync API (documentation for previous sync versions can be found [here](https://docs.msupply.org.nz/other_stuff:remote_sync)).
* For details on the v5 sync API and how it differs from previous mSupply sync versions, see [sync](../../sync).
