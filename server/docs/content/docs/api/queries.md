GraphQL exposes introspection queries, and in dev version of omSupply you can explore the full api by going to /graphiql end point.

Full list of GraphQL queries is provided here is for:

- development specs
- version history
- further description for api devs and consumers

### Invoices

Invoices [list](/docs/api/patterns/#lists)

<ins>Full Shape</ins>

```graphql
query {
  invoices {
    nodes {
      id: String!
      # 'destination' or 'source' of invoice
      otherPartyName: String!
      otherPartyId: String!
      status: InvoiceStatus!
      type: InvoiceType!
      invoiceNumber: Number!
      theirReference: String
      comment: String
      entryDatetime: Datetime!
      confirmDatetime: DateTime
      finalisedDatetime: DateTime
      pricing {
        totalAfterTax: Float!
      }
    }
  }
}
```
`destination` if type is `CUSTOMER_INVOICE`, linked name record represents destination of stock movement

`source` if type is `SUPPLIER_INVOICE`, linked name record represents source of stock movement

Base Table: `invoice`

Field mapping is 1 to 1 converted to snake case, apart from:

**otherPartyId** -> name(`invoice`.`name_id` -> name.id).`id`

**otherPartyName** -> name(`invoice`.`name_id` -> name.id).`name`

`pricing`.`totalAfterTax` -> this is an aggregate of invoice_lines (sum of `total_after_tax`), linked by `invoice`.`id` -> `invoice_line`.`invoice_id`

_{TODO: do we need totalBeforeTax and serviceFee ? }_
</details>

<ins> [Pagination](/docs/api/patterns/#pagination) </ins>

`MAX_PAGE_SIZE`: 1000

`DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`: 100

<ins>Session and Permissions</ins>

Invoices in this query are automatically filtered by permission system so that only invoices associated with current logged in `store` are visible _{TODO link to session info}_ (will output invoice where `store_id = logged in store`)



### Invoice

Single Invoice entity

<ins>Full Shape</ins>

```graphql
query {
  invoice(id: String!) {
    id: String!
    # 'destination' or 'source' of invoice
    otherPartyName: String!
    otherPartyId: String!
    status: InvoiceStatus!
    type: InvoiceType!
    invoiceNumber: Number!
    theirReference: String
    comment: String
    entryDatetime: Datetime!
    confirmDatetime: DateTime
    finalisedDatetime: DateTime
    lines {
      nodes {
        id: String!
        itemId: String!
        itemName: String!
        itemCode: String!
        packSize: String!
        numberOfPacks: Number!
        cost_price_per_pack: Float!
        sell_price_per_pack: Float!
        # name of batch
        batch: String

        stockLine: {
          # number of pack available for a batch ("includes" numberOfPacks in this line)
          availableNumberOfPacks: Number
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

_{TODO do we need stockLine here ? What happen in UI ? Is it a new window to edit quantity (and we show available nubmer of packs there) ?}_

`destination` if type is `CUSTOMER_INVOICE`, linked name record represents destination of stock movement

`source` if type is `SUPPLIER_INVOICE`, linked name record represents source of stock movement
