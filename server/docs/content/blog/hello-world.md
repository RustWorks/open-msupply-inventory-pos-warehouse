Hello!
We're the Open mSupply Development team. 
This first post is a quick note with some history.

mSupply was first developed in the 1990s. Really.
It's still going strong, and if you get us in a skitey mood, we might say its the most-used system for managing health supply chains in low and middle income countries. It's now used in over 30 countries, and several countries a year are installing mSupply.

mSupply mobile, an Android app built with React Native, was our first open source app. 
You can find it here https://github.com/openmsupply/mobile.
