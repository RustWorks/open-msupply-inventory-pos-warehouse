It's now used in over 30 countries, and several countries a year are installing mSupply.\nmSupply mobile, an Android app built with React Native, was our first open source app. \nYou can find it here https://github.com/openmsupply/mobile.\n","id":"http://localhost:8080/blog/hello-msupply/","title":"Hello mSupply"},"http://localhost:8080/docs/":{"body":"","id":"http://localhost:8080/docs/","title":"Docs"},"http://localhost:8080/docs/getting-started/":{"body":"Welcome\nThanks for visiting the Open mSupply developer documentation.\nIf you're looking for \"How to use mSupply\" documentation, you're in the wrong place.

An mSupply installation can only have a single central server.\nRemote server: a server which hosts a remote site.\nSite - a single instance of mSupply. Sites are categorised as either remote or primary.\nRemote site - a site where at least one store is active. A remote site may be running mSupply single user, multi-user, or mobile.\nPrimary site - a remote site which can edit central data. An mSupply installation can only have a single primary site.\nStore - a site can have multiple stores. Stores share central data, but maintain their own remote data. For a given site, a store can be cateorised as activeor collector.\nActive store - if an instance of a store is active on a given site, that site has permission to edit remote data for that store. To ensure data integrity, a store can be active on no more than a single remote site at any given time.\nCollector store - if an instance of a store is marked as a collector on a given site, that site has permission to read but not edit remote data for that store. Every store has a collector instance on the central server.\nStore visibility - for a store to send or recieve stock to or from another store, the stores must be visible to each other. The concept of visibility is symmetrical i.e. if store A is visible in store B, then store B is also visible in store A.\nCentral data data which is only editable on the primary site. Central data is synchronised to all sites via the central server. The main types of central data are items, facilities and categories.\nCentral store data: data which is only editable on the central server. Central store data is synchronised with the site where the store is active. The main types of central store data are store records themselves, stores preferences and store visibility records.\nRemote data: also known as store data, remote data is data which is only editable on a single remote site. Store data is synchronised with the central server. The main types of remote data are transactions, requisitions and stocktakes (and their related child tables, such as transaction_lines, requisition_lines etc.).\nPatient data: patient- or prescriber-related remote data. As with all remote data, this data is only editable on a single remote site (referred to as the home site). Patient data is synchronised via the central server to all sites where the related record is visible. The main types of patient data are patient name records themselves, prescribers, patient medication records and insurance policies.\n\nTypes of sync\n\nThere are two types of sync on the central server:\n\nQueue based (see Sync Queue):\n\nWhen a record is modified (or needs to be sent to a remote site for some other reason, e.g. it is part of a transfer or related to a patient), a record is inserted into the sync_out table (for details, see Sync Queue).\nWhen a remote site connects and requests records, the central server queries the sync_out table for records for that site. It fetches and sends the requested number of records to the client (for details, see Sync API).\nThe client responds when it has successfully saved all records, and the central server deletes the records from the queue.\n\n\nChange log based (see Change Log):\n\nThe central_change_log table has a single record for each record of central data. This record has a u64 serial number*.\nWhen a record is modified or inserted, the serial number is incremented.\nEach remote site maintains a cursor recording its position in the change log. The remote site retrieves records sequentially, incrementing its cursor as it progresses.\nRemote sites are responsible for maintaining their own cursor (remote sites are not responsibile for confirming receipt of records).\n\n\n\n\n\n*Hello Postgres, with your u32 vacuum cleaning ;-).\nChanges from previous versions\n\nThe central_change_log is new.\nStores on the central server can only be collector. Previously they could also be active. This ensures that each store is active on no more than one remote site (the central server has read-only instances of all stores, assuming data is fully synchronised).\nStores on a remote site can only be active. Previously they could also be collector or transfer. This ensures that remote sites can no longer have full read-only instances of stores which are active on other sites (transfers are governed by the visibility of the \"other\" store name in the initiating store).\nPreviously, most central servers were also the primary site. That functionality is now separated out (c.f. mirrored systems), meaning that the primary site is just a special instance of a remote site.\nStores and visibility are controlled on the central server. Previously they were controlled on the primary site for mirrored systems. This means the primary site no longer needs to have instances of any other stores, apart from those which are active.\nAll store data is now synchronised back to the central server. Previously there was a store preference to control whether or not dispensary data was synchronised (done in order to reduce sync traffic from busy dispensary stores).\nTransfers and merges are done on the remote site. Previously they were done on the central server.\nSoft delete is implemented for item and name tables via a status field, which is used for statuses such as merged, a type of delete, and draft, used for new unapproved items and names. The default status of records is active.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is a transaction?\n\ntransaction is a table in mSupply (not to be confused with the concept of a SQL transaction). It mainly stores what are commonly thought of as invoices.\n\nWhy do databases have ids?\n\nPreviously we have had problems with restoration of backup data or having two sites trying to initialise and claiming to be the same site. Having unique identifiers for each databases prevents this occuring. The central server stores the active database id on initialisation, and will not allow connections from a database with a different identifier (remote site data restoration should always ensure that the stored identifier is deleted).\n","id":"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/basics/","title":"Sync Basics"},"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/change-log/":{"body":"Key concepts\nThe change log is a new concept introduced in mSupply sync v5 to address problems with using the sync queue for central data changes.\nMost central data changes need to be synchronised to all remote sites, meaning that an edit to a single central data record can result in sync_out records being created for each site in the system. This is futher compounded by remote sites failing to connect, leading to the sync queue becoming clogged with large numbers of stale records.\nThe change log is designed as a scalable alternative to the sync queue for synchronising central data.\n\nProcessing the change log\n\nThe following psuedo-code describes the algorithm for pulling from the central server change log:\n\nRepeat while not up-to-date:\n  Request records\n  Integrate records (upsert)\n\n","id":"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/change-log/","title":"Change Log"},"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/sync-queue/":{"body":"Key concepts\nThe sync queue functions as a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue of sync_out records, each of which represents an insert, update or delete operation performed on remote and a subset of central data.\nEach sync_out record has the following fields:\nFieldTypeIndexNotes\ncreated_at_timestampdate\niduuid\nrecord_idvarcharB-tree\nsequenceinteger\nstore_idvarchar\ntable_nameinteger\nsite_idinteger\nactionvarchar\"Update\", \"Insert\", \"Delete\" or \"Patch\".\ndatajsonbHashmap of field changes for \"Patch\" records.\n\nInserting\n\n\nCentral server\n\nMost central data tables are handled by central_change_log, with the exception of incoming transfers and site configuration data, e.g.:\n\nWhen a transact representing a finalised customer invoice is pushed from a remote site, a sync_out record is created for the transact, where sync_out.site_id is the site_id for the store linked to transact.name_id.\nWhen a name_store_join record is created, updated or deleted, a corresponding sync_out record is created, where sync_out.site_id is set to the site_id for the store with store.id = name_store_join.store_id.\nWhen an item_store_join record is created, updated or deleted, a corresponding sync_out record is created, where sync_out.site_id is set to the site_id for the store with store.id = name_store_join.store_id.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote servers\n\nAll tables categorised as remote data have a trigger which creates a corresponding sync_out record for every insertion, update and deletion performed on that table.\nTriggers do not update existing sync_out records. This is to prevent race-conditions where a sync_out record is updated after is has already been sent to the server.\nPatient data records (i.e. name records where name.type = patient) are a special case of remote data. In the instance where a patient name record is updated, the sync_outtrigger writes out field-level changes to a sync_out.data as a JSON array of key/value pairs.\n\n\n\nProcessing\n\nIn the context of remote sync, processing the queue refers to pushing sync_out records to the central server.\nThe sync queue is processed on a periodic schedule, with sync_out records pushed in batches.\nBoth period frequency and batch size are defined as preferences. If batch size is not specified, it is calculated on-the-fly according to the following formula:\n\n\nwhere, optimal_duration_per_batch = 5, min_batch_size = 10, max_batch_size = 500.\n\n\nPushing\n\nThe following psuedo-code describes the algorithm for pushing from the sync queue to the central server:\n\nPrune duplicate record_ids from sync_queue\nOrder sync_out records by created_at_timestamp and table_name*\nFor batch_size records:\n  Lookup record in sync_out.table_name with sync_out.record_id\n  Serialise record to JSON**\n  Push serialised record to batch\nSend batch to central server\n\n*Secondary ordering by sync_out.table_name ensures that child records are sent before parents (e.g. trans_line records send before transact records`)\n*See Sync API for JSON format.\nPulling\n\nThe following psuedo-code describes the algorithm for pulling from the central server sync queue:\n\nRepeat while sync_queue is not empty:\n  Request n records from the central server\n  Integrate records into persistent storage:\n    Insert, update, delete according to sync_out.action*\n    Process any messages\n  Send acknowledgement to central server\n\n*This step may require merging records, see Advanced Sync.\n\n\n","id":"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/sync-queue/","title":"Sync Queue"}},"docInfo":{"http://localhost:8080/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://localhost:8080/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://localhost:8080/blog/hello-msupply/":{"body":57,"title":2},"http://localhost:8080/docs/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://localhost:8080/docs/getting-started/":{"body":78,"title":2},"http://localhost:8080/docs/getting-started/key-concepts/":{"body":32,"title":2},"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/advanced/":{"body":412,"title":2},"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/api/":{"body":334,"title":2},"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/basics/":{"body":660,"title":2},"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/change-log/":{"body":85,"title":2},"http://localhost:8080/docs/sync/sync-queue/":{"body":307,"title":2}},"length":12},"lang":"English"};
